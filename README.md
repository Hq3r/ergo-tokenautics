# Ergo Tokenautics

Python script to collect all addresses holding unspent boxes for tokens on the Ergo network.

Data is accumulated daily in this repository's data directory.

Collected data can be explored using the [Ergo Tokenautics Frontend](https://babygrenade.github.io/ergo-tokenautics-frontend/)

To request additional tokens, open an issue with the token name and id.
